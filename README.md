# WorkerMatch -- a web app

## what does it do?

worker match matches job candidates with employers based on the worker's skill
level in some ten languages, frameworks, etc. and the employer's need for 
people with skills in the ten languages, frameworks, etc.

## navigation

the home screen offers the user a choice between the worker survey and the 
employer survey.  once the user chooses on screen, the user completes the
respective survey.  after the user submits his survey information, 
a link appears that will take the user to the user's matching employer or
candidate (depending on whether the user has completed the candidate or 
employer survey).  after view the match, the user may then elect to see more detail about 
the employer/candidcate.  

## how does this work?
I'm really not sure.
